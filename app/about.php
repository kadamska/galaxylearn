						<p><u>The Time Machine Historical Simulator</u> is a free online affinity space where learners, ages 7-18 can collaborate to create by a child working solo, by an informal group formed online, or by whole classrooms.</p>
						
						<p><u>Students</u> are encouraged to keep their own copies of their writing, research and image collections, to form a personal portfolio.</p>

						<p><u>Parents and teachers</u> are encouraged to give as specific prompts as they feel are helpful, from open-ended choice to challenges for learners.</p>
						
						<p><u>Safety:</u> There is no direct communication between users, each user has her own anonymous screen name, and all material published is curated by an adult guide and Galaxy Learn.</p>
